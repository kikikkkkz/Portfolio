                </div>

            <div class="grid-box">
                <h2 class="p-title">Overview</h2>
                <p>The project is a branding redesign for a clientâ€™s start-up company "Brilliant Signs & Ceiling Solutions", which deals with decorating signs and ceilings. The collection of visual design includes a logo, business card, and website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-box">
                <h2 class="p-title">Process</h2>
                <p>I began by brainstorming a list of possible symbols or icons that could be used. However, it was not easy to visualize the logo, as "signs and ceilings" were difficult to represent by a single icon or symbol. On the other hand, the clients didn't want to use the initials of their company as a logo because it might cause ambiguity. Thus, designing the logo with the company's initials was not a solution.</p>
                <p>I took a look at the company's products and the services. The company mainly focused on making light boxes made by LED lights and decorated ceilings with stretchable vinyl materials. To incorporate both these main features, I needed to find a common component between the two. Since the clients wanted a logo to represent their company, I decided to use LED lights as they are used in both their main works. Using the symbol of a LED light/light bulb in the logo design works well with their brand because it shows that their installations have something to do with lighting, and it matches their brand name "Brilliant" as well.</p>

                <p class="img-caption">Figure 1 | Sketches of icons and fonts combination</p>
                <p>From the lightbulb image idea, I looked up LED light images on the Internet, then compared and modified them using Adobe Illustrator. I drew several sketches, selected four types of font, and tried out different combinations of the layout for testing (figure 1). The fonts I selected were all sans serif, which looked clean and modern. I tried arranging the font in a radian shape around the light bulb, but it looked informal and too playful which was not a part of their company style. To go with something a bit more formal and closer to the theme of lights, I chose a calligraphy font. This font worked well for the text as the tails of each letter looked like wires, and as if the light bulb was connected to a circuit. After showing the above collection of sketches (figure 1) to the clients, they chose the ideal one (figure 3 below) for their brand.</p>

            <div class="grid-box">
                <h2 class="p-title">Problems and Solutions</h2>
                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <p><img src="img/1-oldlogo.jpg" class="project-img" alt="old logo of brilliant solutions"></p>
                    <p class="img-caption">Figure 2 | Old logo of the company</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <p><img src="img/1-logo.png" class="project-img" alt="new logo of brilliant solutions"></p>
                    <p class="img-caption">Figure 3 | New logo I designed</p>
                </div>
                <p>The original design of their company logo was as shown in figure 2. The client was not satisfied with it because they thought it was too simple and it couldn't represent their company/products well in a creative way. I solved the problem by communicating well with the client and asked for their opinions as I designed the logo. This iterative design process went back and forth several times to keep the clients up-to-date and for me to receive their instant feedback.</p>

                <h2 class="p-title">Reflection</h2>
                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <p><img src="img/1-card.png" class="project-img" alt="business card"></p>
                    <p class="img-caption">Figure 4 | Business card</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <p><img src="img/1-website.png" class="project-img" alt="website screenshot"></p>
                    <p class="img-caption">Figure 5 | Website</p>
                </div>
                <p>The client was satisfied with my design because of its creativity and uniqueness. They thought the redesign gives their brand a new genetic image. The new logo was put into use on their business card (figure 4), website (figure 5), and invoice. I continued to apply the theme of light bulbs across all their branding products. After finishing this logo design, I learned more about how to communicate with the clients, and where to draw my inspiration from during the ideation process. Furthermore, I was able to take away the skill of manipulating Illustrator and designing layouts with balanced composition.</p>
