                <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
                <p>TagAStreet is an Android app I developed. Targeting at street style photography, TagAStreet allows users to add tags to their uploaded photos and view photos they want to see with selective tags. With few simple clicks, an outfit picture can be taken, tagged and shared within one single app. By clicking one to as many tags, pictures will be filtered automatically and viewed clearly. The application provides a fast and easy way of keeping as well as seeking daily outfit inspiration for the users.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Proposal</h3>
                <p>Based on my own experience, I find it hard to filter a collection of images I want, whether using the search function in Google or using the tag in Instagram. Therefore, I came up with an app that can select multiple tags to filter the desired images.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Prototype</h3>
                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <div class="parent">
                        <img src="img/2-phone.png" class="project-img"/>
                        <img src="img/2-gif-1.gif" class="project-gif over-img"/>

                <div class="sub-grid-box">
                    <p>To begin, I drew a sitemap to identify the structure of the app. Then, I sketched out the layout in Sketch. After that, I built the basic framework in Android Studio and started to implement all the functions I proposed. In the end, I tested it out with my friend the received feedback to improve.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Problems and Solutions</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, the purpose of the app in my original proposal was to upload street style pictures and share with people. However, at this stage, I only learned how to store images in local storage and did not figure out the web server part. After speaking with the professor, I realized the app can also serve another purpose. Therefore, I changed my main function of the app to “keeping your daily outfit inspo”, which can store the images and view the images in the user’s own phone.</p>

            <div class="grid-box">
                <h2 class="title">Reflection</h2>
                <p>For this project, I simply assumed the users' need based on my own experience instead of doing field research. As for designing a real product, I would need to go into the market and do questionnaires or observations to test if my assumption of "users wish to narrow down the image pool by selecting multiple tags" is a problem.</p>
